## Synopsis

This is currently the first iteration of a Multi Twitch builder for the site beta.multitwitch.net. It currently only points to the streamers currently streaming from Valhallas Most Wanted stream community.

## Motivation

I made this script because the community I am a part of, Valhallas Most Wanted, always had issues with who was streaming and buuilding multi twitches for people who wanted to watch all of us.

## Installation

Once downloaded, open up the scripts portion of Anhkbot. Click the Import symbol in the top right and select the zip file you just downloaded. Enable the script and ti should now work!
